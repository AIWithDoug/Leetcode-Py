# setup a dummy, a current to track to location as we cant jump to a certain index.
# and a carry so we know whats leftover.

# while we have digits left in l1, l2 or in the carry
# get the value from l1 and l2, if empty it has to be 0
# or it will try and add None which will error

# add them all together, % by 10 to get the left over.
# insert the new number (leftover) into the ListNode as a new
# number, set current.next to the new_node we just made to make
# sure it is the next in the list and not skipped

# repeat until the lists are done and return dummy_head.next
# we do that instead of just dummy_head, as its 0 by default
# we do not want that to be included√ü
